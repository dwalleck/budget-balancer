# Feature Specification: Budget Balancer - Debt Management & Spending Insights

**Feature Branch**: `001-build-an-application`
**Created**: 2025-10-04
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Build an application to give users insight into their spending and help them create plans to pay off their debts and know how well they are sticking to that plan. We should support avalanche and snowball payoff metholodogies. Users should be able to upload their credit card and bank statements as a CSV, ideally with the ability to pull these amounts directly from the source in the future. There should be helpful visualizations to help the user see the progress they are making on their debts and how well they are sticking to spending targets. The user should be able to set spending targets for different categories of purchases"

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-04
- Q: What is the user account model for this application? ‚Üí A: Single-user local application (one user per installation, data stored locally)
- Q: How should the system handle CSV file formats? ‚Üí A: Support flexible column mapping (user selects which column maps to Date, Amount, etc.)
- Q: How should duplicate transactions be handled? ‚Üí A: Automatically skip duplicates silently (based on date + amount + description match)
- Q: What time ranges should users be able to view for spending analysis? ‚Üí A: Monthly, quarterly, yearly, and custom date range
- Q: What specific visualization types are required for progress tracking? ‚Üí A: Progress bars, pie charts, bar graphs, and line graphs for trends
- Q: How should the system handle automatic transaction categorization? ‚Üí A: Predefined categories with merchant keyword matching (system has built-in rules)
- Q: Should financial data be encrypted at rest on local storage? ‚Üí A: No encryption needed (rely on OS/device level encryption only)

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
Sarah has $15,000 in credit card debt across three cards with different interest rates and wants to pay it off strategically. She uploads her monthly bank statements and credit card statements as CSV files into Budget Balancer. The system analyzes her spending patterns, categorizes her purchases, and shows her where her money is going. Sarah sets spending targets for different categories like dining out and entertainment. She creates a debt payoff plan using the avalanche method (highest interest rate first) and sees visualizations showing her projected debt-free date. Each month, she uploads new statements and sees her progress against both her spending targets and debt payoff plan, with clear visualizations showing whether she's on track.

### Acceptance Scenarios
*Each scenario MUST be testable and will map to integration tests*

1. **Given** a user has CSV files containing bank and credit card transactions, **When** they upload these files to the system, **Then** the system imports all transactions and categorizes them

2. **Given** a user has imported their transactions, **When** they view their spending analysis, **Then** they see a breakdown of spending by category with totals, percentages, and pie chart visualization

3. **Given** a user has multiple debts with different balances and interest rates, **When** they create a debt payoff plan using the avalanche method, **Then** the system generates a payment schedule prioritizing debts by highest interest rate first

4. **Given** a user has multiple debts with different balances and interest rates, **When** they create a debt payoff plan using the snowball method, **Then** the system generates a payment schedule prioritizing debts by smallest balance first

5. **Given** a user has set spending targets for specific categories, **When** they view their progress, **Then** they see whether they are under, at, or over their targets with progress bar indicators

6. **Given** a user has a debt payoff plan and has made payments, **When** they view their debt progress, **Then** they see visualizations including progress bars for remaining debt, bar graphs for payments made, and line graphs showing payoff trajectory

7. **Given** a user uploads new transaction data, **When** the system processes it, **Then** spending category totals and debt progress are automatically updated

### Edge Cases
*Each edge case MUST have corresponding test coverage*

- What happens when a CSV file has an unrecognized format or missing required columns?
- When a transaction cannot be automatically categorized by merchant keyword matching, system assigns it to "Uncategorized" for user review
- What happens when a user's actual spending exceeds their available budget after debt payments?
- What happens when a user pays off a debt ahead of schedule?
- What happens when a user adds a new debt to an existing payoff plan?
- What happens when interest rates change on existing debts?
- When a CSV file contains duplicate transactions (same date, amount, description), system skips them automatically during import
