# Budget Balancer Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Development Philosophy
Applications MUST be easy to develop, test, and maintain. Code maintainability and developer experience are non-negotiable priorities. Every design decision MUST consider long-term maintenance costs and developer onboarding time.

**Rationale**: Sustainable software development requires code that can be understood, modified, and extended efficiently. Poor maintainability compounds technical debt exponentially over time.

### II. Substance Over Flash
User experience and application functionality MUST take priority over visual impressions. The system MUST prioritize how users feel about the application's functionality and usability rather than superficial UI aesthetics.

**Rationale**: Long-term user satisfaction derives from reliable, intuitive functionality. Users value applications that work well over applications that merely look impressive but fail to deliver on core needs.

### III. Test-Driven Development (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
Tests MUST always be written alongside the feature being developed. For any feature to be deployed without tests, explicit leadership signoff is required. Testability is a top priority in all architectural and implementation decisions.

**Requirements**:
- Every feature MUST have corresponding automated tests
- Tests MUST be written before or during feature development (TDD/test-first approach preferred)
- Contract tests MUST be written for all API interfaces
- Integration tests MUST be written for user scenarios
- Untested code requires documented leadership exception

**Rationale**: Testing is not optional or deferred work—it is core to delivering reliable software. Test-first development catches defects early, ensures requirements are testable, and serves as living documentation.

## Development Standards

### Code Quality
- All code MUST pass linting and formatting standards
- Code reviews MUST verify test coverage
- Complexity MUST be justified and documented
- Refactoring MUST maintain or improve test coverage

### Testing Hierarchy
1. **Contract Tests**: Verify API interfaces and data contracts
2. **Integration Tests**: Validate user scenarios and workflows
3. **Unit Tests**: Test individual components and business logic
4. **Performance Tests**: Ensure acceptable response times and resource usage

### Documentation
- Public APIs MUST have usage documentation
- Complex algorithms MUST have explanatory comments
- Architecture decisions MUST be documented with rationale
- Quickstart guides MUST be maintained for new features

## Governance

### Amendment Process
Constitution amendments require:
1. Documented proposal with rationale
2. Leadership review and approval
3. Update to version number (semantic versioning)
4. Propagation to all dependent templates and documentation

### Compliance
- All pull requests MUST verify constitutional compliance
- Design reviews MUST reference constitution principles
- Exceptions MUST be documented with justification
- Regular audits MUST verify adherence to testing requirements

### Enforcement
- Test coverage gates MUST block deployment of untested code
- Code review checklist MUST include constitution verification
- Automated checks MUST enforce formatting and linting standards
- Leadership exceptions MUST be tracked and reviewed quarterly

**Version**: 1.0.0 | **Ratified**: 2025-10-04 | **Last Amended**: 2025-10-04
