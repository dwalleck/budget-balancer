# GitHub Actions Deprecation Fix

## Issue
All GitHub Actions workflows were failing due to deprecated action versions:
```
Error: This request has been automatically failed because it uses a deprecated version of `actions/upload-artifact: v3`.
```

## Fixed ✅

Updated all deprecated GitHub Actions to their latest versions:

| Action | Old Version | New Version |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| `actions/cache` | v3 | v4 |
| `actions/upload-artifact` | v3 | v4 |
| `codecov/codecov-action` | v3 | v4 |

## Already Up-to-Date ✅

These actions were already using the latest versions:
- `actions/checkout@v4`
- `oven-sh/setup-bun@v1`
- `dtolnay/rust-toolchain@stable`

## Changes Made

### Updated 3 instances of `actions/cache@v3` → `@v4`
- Line 31: Lint job
- Line 78: Test-backend job
- Line 154: Build job

### Updated 5 instances of `actions/upload-artifact@v3` → `@v4`
- Line 95: Backend test results
- Line 121: Frontend test results
- Line 175: Linux build artifacts
- Line 184: macOS build artifacts
- Line 193: Windows build artifacts

### Updated 2 instances of `codecov/codecov-action@v3` → `@v4`
- Line 224: Backend coverage upload
- Line 243: Frontend coverage upload

## Testing

To verify the fix works:

```bash
# Commit and push the changes
git add .github/workflows/ci.yml
git commit -m "fix(ci): Update deprecated GitHub Actions to v4"
git push
```

The CI/CD pipeline should now run successfully without deprecation errors.
